# Concert-Ticket-Booking

#Online Concert Ticket Booking in the Blockchain using the Hyperledger Fabric.

#Event management usually needs to undergo a middle man ticketing service, which facilitates thesale of tickets. Likewise, event attendees can only purchase tickets through this middleman, who takes roughly5-10% of ticket revenues as commission. Another issue is ticketing fraud- tickets may be replicated, which aids unauthorised admissions and loss of revenue for hosts. A ticketing Distributed App using ethereum would resolve all the difficulties stated above. Any Event holders can sprightly sell their event tickets through the DistributedApp with easiness and Convenience. We are going to have a hard and fast number of tickets and every ticket will have the ownership of concert holders. When a customer had done the payment through ethereum wallet then the ownership of the tickets are changed to the customer. Once the ownership is modified there'll be no chance of fixing the ownership of tickets thereby ticket deception may be avoided. Once tickets are bought, the ownership of those tickets would be transferred to the buyers. Developing the DistributedApp can avoid ticket fraud furthermore and prevents external hacks to control the tickets.
Event Ticket Network
=====================


> This is a ticket marketplace  demo for Hyperledger Composer. Create events (eg sporting events, concerts, church picnics etc) and create tickets for those events.  Event tickets can be bought at face value and then redeemed at the event. Buyers can list tickets they have bought and other buyers can buy them (usuallyat prices higher than face value).  By using a Blockchain to record all these transactions, buyers can be assured that they are buying legitimate tickets eliminating much of the fraud that happens on marketplaces like Craigslist. The blockchain will record the entire lifecycle of each ticket, from the  point when it is issued, to when it's sold (and possibly resold multiple times ) to when it is  redeeemed.

Business Network Description
============================

This business network defines:

**Participants:**

`Member` `EventHost`

   *Member* - A member of the general public that can buy and resell tickets.
   
   *EventHost* - The entity hosting an event and issuing tickets for it.

**Assets:**

`Ticket` `TicketListing` `Event`

   *Event* An event for which tickets are issued.
   
   *Ticket* - An individual ticket to a specific event.
   
   *TicketListing* - A listing to resell a ticket already purchased for an event

**Transactions:**

`CreateTicketedEvent` `RedeemTicket` `SellTicket` `ResellTicket`

   *CreateTicketedEvent* - Creates an event as well as the associated tickets. 
   
   *SellTicket* -  Used to record the sale of a ticket by the Event Host to a member.
   
   *ResellTicket* -  Used to record the resale  of a ticket to another member.
   
   *RedeemTicket* -  Records when the ticket is used at the event.

Part 2. Test the Business Network
=================================
     
1.  Test the network by creating participants, assets and running some transactions.

    
    In the `EventHost` participant registry, create a new participant with the following data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.EventHost",
      "email": "jones@email.com",
      "firstName": "Pastor",
      "lastName": "Jones"
    }
    ```

    In the `Member` participant registry, create two participants with the following data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.Member",
      "email": "memberA@email.com",
      "firstName": "Amy",
      "lastName": "Williams"
    }

    {

      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.Member",
      "email": "memberB@email.com",
      "firstName": "Billy",
      "lastName": "Thompson"
    }
    ```

    Submit a `CreateTicketedEvent` transaction, by clicking on **Submit Transaction**  and selecting `CreateTicketedEvent` from the dropdown. Use the following input data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.CreateTicketedEvent",
      "eventId": "1001",

      "host": {
        "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.EventHost",
        "email": "jones@email.com",
        "firstName": "Pastor",
        "lastName": "Jones"
      }
    }
    ```

    Submit a `SellTicket` transaction, by submitting a transaction and selecting `SellTicket` from the dropdown. Use the following input data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.SellTicket",

      "ticket": "resource:org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.Ticket#1"
    }
    ```

    In the `TicketListing` asset registry create a new ticket listing. Use the following input data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.TicketListing",
      "listingId": "1",
      "state": "FOR_SALE",
      "listingPrice": 12,
      "ticket": "resource:org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.Ticket#1"
    }
    ```

    Submit a `ResellTicket` transaction, by submitting a transaction and selecting `ResellTicket` from the dropdown. Use the following input data.

    ```
    {
      "$class": "org.ibm.demo.ticketmarketplace.ResellTicket",

    If you click on the `Ticket` asset registry you can check the status  of each Ticket. You should see that one ticket was redeemed and all the others are unsold.

    Congratulations! You've successfully created and tested a Business Network.
