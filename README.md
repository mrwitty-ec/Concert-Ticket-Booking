# Concert-Ticket-Booking
Online Concert Ticket Booking in the Blockchain using the Hyperledger Fabric.
 Event management usually needs to undergo a middle man ticketing service, which facilitates thesale of tickets. Likewise, event attendees can only purchase tickets through this middleman, who takes roughly5-10% of ticket revenues as commission. Another issue is ticketing fraud- tickets may be replicated, which aids unauthorised admissions and loss of revenue for hosts. A ticketing Distributed App using ethereum would resolve all the difficulties stated above. Any Event holders can sprightly sell their event tickets through the DistributedApp with easiness and Convenience. We are going to have a hard and fast number of tickets and every ticket will have the ownership of concert holders. When a customer had done the payment through ethereum wallet then the ownership of the tickets are changed to the customer. Once the ownership is modified there'll be no chance of fixing the ownership of tickets thereby ticket deception may be avoided. Once tickets are bought, the ownership of those tickets would be transferred to the buyers. Developing the DistributedApp can avoid ticket fraud furthermore and prevents external hacks to control the tickets.
